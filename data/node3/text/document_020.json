Differential privacy adds noise to protect individual records. Homomorphic encryption allows computation on encrypted data. Zero-knowledge proofs verify computations without revealing data. Additional information about learning. Machine learning models can be trained collaboratively. Privacy-preserving techniques protect sensitive data. This is a sample document for federated learning.

Privacy-preserving techniques protect sensitive data. Multi-party computation enables secure computation. Differential privacy adds noise to protect individual records. Homomorphic encryption allows computation on encrypted data. Federated learning allows training without data sharing. Homomorphic encryption allows computation on encrypted data. Zero-knowledge proofs verify computations without revealing data. Additional information about data. lzfqb ezpedea

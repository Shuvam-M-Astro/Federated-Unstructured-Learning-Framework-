Machine learning models can be trained collaboratively. Differential privacy adds noise to protect individual records. Additional information about learning. Differential privacy adds noise to protect individual records. Additional information about data. Secure aggregation combines model updates safely. Distributed training enables large-scale model development. Homomorphic encryption allows computation on encrypted data. Zero-knowledge proofs verify computations without revealing data. atllhas pojblzf wnqoasja

Differential privacy adds noise to protect individual records. Additional information about data. Secure aggregation combines model updates safely. Distributed training enables large-scale model development. Homomorphic encryption allows computation on encrypted data. Zero-knowledge proofs verify computations without revealing data. atllhas pojblzf wnqoasja",
